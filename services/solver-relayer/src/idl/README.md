# IDL Generation

The `darkpool.json` IDL file is required for the solver-relayer to interact with the Anchor program.

## Generate IDL

After building the darkpool Anchor program:

```bash
cd ../../../programs/darkpool
anchor build
cp target/idl/darkpool.json ../../services/solver-relayer/src/idl/darkpool.json
```

The IDL will be automatically generated by Anchor when you run `anchor build` in the `programs/darkpool` directory.

## What is the IDL?

The IDL (Interface Definition Language) is a JSON file that describes:
- All instructions (functions) in the program
- All account structures
- All types and enums
- Program metadata

The solver-relayer uses this IDL to:
- Type-check interactions with the program
- Serialize/deserialize account data
- Build transactions correctly
